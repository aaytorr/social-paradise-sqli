## 🚀 Key Improvements

- **🔁 MySQLi Migration**: We've moved away from the outdated MySQL extension to the more secure and robust MySQLi.
- **🔒 Enhanced Security**: We've fortified the codebase by patching numerous security loopholes to enhance user safety.
- **🐞 Bug Squashing**: We've fixed a plethora of bugs lingering from the original version to ensure a bug-free experiance.
- **📂 Streamlined Directories**: We've reorganized the directory structure for improved clarity and easier maintenance.
- **🔐 Advanced Password Hashing**: We've upgraded our password hashing to a more secure standard.

## 📊 Project Progress

We are about 60% through the makeover. Although we've made great strides, there's still tons of work to be done to polish and perfect the project.

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

Get "Social Paradise Rewritten" up and running by following these steps:

### 📋 Prerequisites

- PHP version 8.0 or higher
- MySQL database setup
- Required PHP and MySQL dependencies

### 🚀 Installation

1. **File Upload**: Transfer all project files to your server.
2. **Database Configuration**: Use a tool like phpMyAdmin to import the `database.sql` file to your MySQL database.
3. **Settings Adjustment**: Modify the settings in `Global.php` to match your database information:
   - `$host`
   - `$username`
   - `$password`
   - `$database`

### 📌 Additional Notes

- **Maintenance Mode**: If you're greeted by a maintenance page, use "speaknow13" as the password—a little homage to Taylor Swift's "Speak Now" album. Remember to check out "Speak Now (Taylor's Version)" too! 🎶
- **Admin Access**: If you can't log in as "Isaac," set up a new admin account and transfer the password hash to "Isaac" using phpMyAdmin. This is a temporary fix until we fully implement the new permission system.
